                        I&apos;m still new to the world of programming, but I
                        catch up quickly — and my background in design has
                        taught me that logic, aesthetics, and good structure
                        (not just in code!) are what really matter.

                      My components are so well thought out they could have
                      their own résumés. If a problem pops up, I’ll find a
                      solution faster than Ctrl+F. And when I don’t know
                      something, I’m not afraid to ask — good communication is
                      key.

                      Away from the screen? You’ll probably find me sketching,
                      woodworking, running miles, drinking tea, or indulging in
                      way too much pasta.
